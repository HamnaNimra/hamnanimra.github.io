# Photography images

Add your photos here so they appear on the **Photography** page.

**From Instagram:** open [instagram.com/hamnanimra](https://www.instagram.com/hamnanimra/), choose a post → ⋯ → Save photo (or use a download tool), then save the file here with one of these names:

| Save as       | Shows as   |
|---------------|-----------|
| `insta-1.jpg` | Photo 1   |
| `insta-2.jpg` | Photo 2   |
| `insta-3.jpg` | Photo 3   |
| `insta-4.jpg` | Photo 4   |
| `insta-5.jpg` | Photo 5   |

You can edit the titles in `_photography/insta-1.md` … `insta-5.md` (change the `title:` line).  
PNG is fine too (e.g. `insta-1.png`) — update the `.md` file’s `image:` path to match.
